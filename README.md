# Description
基于Xposed，去除一加系统锁屏和AOD时钟红色字体样式的模块。

An Xposed module to prevent Oneplus from making red "1" digits on the clocks.

If you hate the red "1" characters on the lock screen clock and AOD (Always-On Display) clock like me, you may try this Xposed module to get rid of it.

Supports OOS 11, OOS 12, and OOS 13.
