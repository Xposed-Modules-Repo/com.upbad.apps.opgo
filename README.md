# Description
基于Xposed，去除一加系统锁屏，AOD和状态栏时钟红色字体样式的模块。

An Xposed module to prevent Oneplus from making red "1" digits on the keyguard, AOD (Always-On Display), and status bar clocks.

If you hate the red "1" characters on the clocks like me, you may try this Xposed module to get rid of it.

Supports OOS 11, OOS 12, OOS 13, and OOS 14.
